**Predict flow And Influent Wastewater Characteristics**

**Problem Background Objective**

Wastewater contains various organic components with different physical and biochemical characteristics. Water data collected from the last 20 years is analyzed and used for training the model. This data has many missing values which need to be handled. The features of this data are Total Solids, BOD5, P-TOT, SS, Org-n, PRCP_NOOA, NH3, SO4, and TKN. Based on other features that are currently available, we evaluate the data and provide the best recommendation for forecasting each water parameter in this. We pre-processed the water dataset to replace any null values with the feature's mean value before carrying out full data analysis to ascertain the relevance of relevant features. We have used 6 different models â€“ Linear Regressor, Logistic Regressor, Lasso Regressor, Ridge Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The accuracy of the models created is calculated using Mean Absolute Percentage Error. The result has been evaluated using R2 Square Error and Accuracy. This investigation helps in comparing all the models and choosing the best model.

**INTRODUCTION**

Wastewater is any water that has been affected by human use. Wastewater is "used water from any combination of domestic, industrial, commercial or agricultural activities, surface runoff or stormwater, and any sewer inflow or sewer infiltration". Therefore, wastewater is a byproduct of domestic, industrial, commercial, or agricultural activities. The characteristics of wastewater vary depending on the source. Types of wastewater include domestic wastewater from households, municipal wastewater from communities and industrial wastewater. Wastewater can contain physical, chemical and biological pollutants.
